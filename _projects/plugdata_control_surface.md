During the years I've been experimenting with a plethora of physical and digital controllers, and each time unsatisfied with the results.

Thanks to the wonderful work of the people at [plugdata](https://plugdata.org), a version of Pure Data that can also be used as a plugin, I started writing a collection of GUI objects written in [Pd-Lua](https://agraef.github.io/pd-lua/tutorial/pd-lua-intro.html).

This project is at a very initial stage, but the results are so far very promising! 

Check this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/liberomureddu/pdlua_control_surface_objects) to download the externals and follow this project.
