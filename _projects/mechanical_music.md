I began working with the Yamaha Disklavier in 2005, and since then I have been active as a composer and as a performer of music written for this instrument.

## Canons for player piano

My first composition for the Disklavier is called 'Déploration sur la mort de G. L.' (2006), an 88-part canon, originally written with Pure Data. In 2017 I began to compose new canons using Supercollider.

## Performing with player pianos
As a performer, my first contact with the Disklavier happened in 2005, while assisting Jean-Claude Risset and pianist Elisa Järvi for the performance of Risset's 'Duets for One Pianist'. Since then I have been regularly working with the Disklavier, as a performer or assisting other composers or performers.

## Curating mechanical music

Since 2012 I have been the curator of a concert series of Disklavier music called 'Mechanical and Live Music', hosted at the MuTeFest, the annual festival of the Centre for Music & Technology, Sibelius Academy of the University of the Arts Helsinki.
