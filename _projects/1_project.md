In my second doctoral concert, titled 'Sonic Avatars', the musicians on stage respond to video recordings of their own performances. These digital doubles, the Avatars, are controlled in real time by four other hidden performers. During the concert, algorithmically generated videos emerge, where each Avatar influences the others, eventually overshadowing the original material. By the end of the performance, it becomes impossible to visually and acoustically distinguish who is controlling and who is being controlled.

Sonic Avatars continues my exploration of the improviserâ€™s embodied knowledge within an unconventional performative space akin to a laboratory. By observing how performers interact with this unfamiliar environment, I aim to understand how their extensive yet invisible improvisational knowledge is applied in real time. Unlike my first doctoral concert (link), where players followed random written instructions from software, in Sonic Avatars they react to their own sounds and images. The premiere took place on October 25, 2023, at the Helsinki Music Centre.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
