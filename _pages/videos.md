Description: Giorgio Convertito (dance), Moritz Cartheuser (electric guitar and effects), Libero Mureddu (piano and keyboards) and Terhi Vaimala (dance). Liquid is a music quartet composed of two dancers and two musicians. The group’s particular feature are the dancers thinking and behaving as instrumentalist, producing visual music and interacting with the musicians to create unique sound flavours and to literally project the music in the third dimension of space.

Description: Libero Mureddu (piano and keyboards) and Moritz Cartheuser (guitar and objects) started their collaboration in 2013 as the sounding fraction of the multidisciplinary improvisation quartet Liquid and soon began to work in the reduced form of a duo. Their pieces, inspired by their work with the Liquid Quartet, are homages to spatiality and movement, reflecting the musical background of both performers in jazz and noise-rock as well as electroacoustic and classical music, but being at the same time uncategorizable and never predictable.
