On the screen, a number of coloured stripes with text will appear. Each player should follow a different stripe throughout the piece. The players have to follow their changing instructions as quickly as possible. However, they are free to interpret the instructions as they wish. <br><br> The composition already contains ~300 different instructions. However, one can use their own set of instructions or, in a future version, add their instructions to the existing ones. </div> <div class="input-group"> <label for="numPlayers">Enter the number of players:</label> <button onclick="changePlayers(-1)">-</button> <input type="number" id="numPlayers" min="1" max="20" value="7"> <button onclick="changePlayers(1)">+</button> </div> <div class="input-group"> <label for="duration">Enter the total duration (mm:ss):</label> <button onclick="changeDuration(-1)">-</button> <input type="text" id="duration" placeholder="mm:ss" pattern="\d{2}:\d{2}" value="00:30"> <button onclick="changeDuration(1)">+</button> </div> <div class="input-group"> <label for="userTexts">Enter your instructions (comma-separated):</label> <textarea id="userTexts" rows="3" placeholder="Text 1, Text 2, Text 3"></textarea> </div> <button onclick="startAnimation()">Start</button> </div> <div id="intro" class="hidden">Hello.
